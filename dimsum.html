    <p class="dimsumparagraph">Dim Sum is a key part of Cantonese food. There are more than 1,000 kinds of dim sums in Guangdong Area, and in Xiguan District in Guangzhou, where Cantonese dim sum originated is your best place to enjoy the dim sums, including the Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gow), Siu Mai (Shaomai), Rice Noodle Roll (Cheong Fun), Turnip Cakes , Steamed Buns Stuffed with BBQ Roast Pork (Char Siu Bao), Salted Egg Yolk Buns , Chicken Feet, Egg Tarts, etc. As they are made in exquisite outlook and fresh flavor, no matter you like sweet or salty flavor, you can have a wonderful time in the morning tea restaurant as local Cantonese do.

    The islands of Hong Kong and Macao lie on the coastal edge of Guangdong province at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta and were governed for many years by two European colonial powers, the British Empire and Portugal, respectively. Both colonies have left their mark upon Cantonese cuisine. The best-known Portuguese influenced dish would have to be the egg tart, or dan tat, now found in bakeries and dim sum restaurants from Vancouver to Hong Kong. At one time dim sum was humble, cheap street food, but these days, in Chinese communities, it’s served in palatial dining halls.

    Wildly popular in Hong Kong and quickly gaining a world wide fan base, Dim Sum is as much a social experience as a meal. Literally meaning to touch heart, Dim Sum is about groups of friends dining together and sharing lots of bite sized dishes..You’ll usually sit around a revolving table and order a selection of dishes by picking them from a small cart or ticking what you want on a small card. All dishes are then shared.
